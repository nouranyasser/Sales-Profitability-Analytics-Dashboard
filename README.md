## 🔍 Key Insights

✅ Mountain bikes and HL Mountain Frame models dominate in sales and profitability  
📉 Some categories (e.g., Shorts, Helmets) contribute low margins — potential for bundling or promotion  
🌍 North America leads in sales revenue and margin contribution  
👥 A small number of customers contribute disproportionately high revenue  
🚩 Certain customers generate less than $100 total sales — may require targeted engagement or churn analysis

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- **Inventory Optimization**: Focus stocking and marketing efforts on top-selling models (e.g., Mountain-100, HL Mountain Frame).

- **Regional Scaling**: Expand efforts in top-performing regions; North America shows strong ROI.  
- **Category Strategy**: Bundle low-margin items with popular ones or run clearance campaigns.  
- **Profitability Tracking**: Regularly monitor cost-heavy products with low margins for potential phase-out.
